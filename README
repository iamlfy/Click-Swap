🎮 Game: Shuffle Puzzle

A simple puzzle game implemented in C with the raylib
 library.
The game splits an image into tiles, shuffles them, and lets you swap adjacent tiles to restore the original picture.

✨ Features

Load and resize any image to fit the window.

Split the image into a x*y grid.

Shuffle the tiles at the beginning of the game.

Click two adjacent tiles to swap them.

(Optional) Detect when the puzzle is solved.

🎮 How to Play

The image is divided into x*y blocks and displayed in a shuffled order.

Click one tile, then click an adjacent tile (left, right, up, or down).

If the move is valid, the two tiles will swap.

Continue until all tiles return to their original positions.

💡 Invalid moves will show a warning message.
